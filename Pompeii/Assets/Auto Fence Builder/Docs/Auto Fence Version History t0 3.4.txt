3.0

Backup your Project Folder if you intend to overwrite a project currently using Auto Railtrack Builder. Preferably test-drive v3.0 in a new project first.
• 'Finish' any live fences
• Drag the folder 'UserGeneratedRailMeshes' out of the old Auto Railtrack Builder folder in the Assets folder
• Completely remove the old version of Auto Railtrack Builder from the Hierarchy and the Project (Assets Folder). 
Game Objects will have missing textures (and appear pink) after removing the old version, but will return when importing this new version.
• After importing AFWB 3.0, put the 'UserGeneratedRailMeshes' folder back in to the top level of the 'Auto Railtrack Builder' folder
