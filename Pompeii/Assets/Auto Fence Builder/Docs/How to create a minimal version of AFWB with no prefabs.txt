This will allow you to create and export a package that has only the Auto Fence toolset and no prefab content, in the case that you only ant to use your own custom GameObjects as prefabs for AFWB.

Important: Do this in a new clean project. Do not do this in a project that already uses AFWB, it would break all connections to the fence objects in your scene.


• Find the file  'AutoFenceConfig'  in Auto Fence Builder/Editor/
• Enable 'Allow Content Free Tool'
• Delete the following folders:
        Auto Fence Builder/FencePrefabs_AFWB  
        Auto Fence Builder/Presets_AFWB
        Auto Fence Builder/AFWB_Materials
        Auto Fence Builder/AFWB_Textures
• Select the Auto Fence Builder in your Assets folder, right click and 'Export Package...'
• First select 'None' to ensure there are no hidden assets being exported, then enable 'Auto Fence Builder' and export to your prefered location.
• You can now import this package in to a project to use the minimal version

There will be only one test preset available in this mode (as the necessary prefabs are missing), though you may still save your own.

If returning to the normal version of Auto Fence, don't forget to disable 'Allow Content Free Tool' in the AutoFenceConfig file.
