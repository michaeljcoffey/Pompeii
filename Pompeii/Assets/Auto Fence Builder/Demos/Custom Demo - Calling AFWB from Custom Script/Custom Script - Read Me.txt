To see how to access AFWB from your own scripts:

Load the ‘Calling AFWB from Custom Script’ scene.
Select Auto Fence Builder (This is just to ‘wake’ it)
Select Custom Script Demo, and in its Inspector press ‘Test’

If you look in the attached script you can see that both the positions and design have been set by calling AFWB’s main class directly.

You're welcome to contact support if you need more help with this, or info on what AFWB parameters are available.
