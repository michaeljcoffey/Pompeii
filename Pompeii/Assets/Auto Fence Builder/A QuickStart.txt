Troubleshooting:


Ensure Auto Fence Builder is selected in the Hierarchy when trying to build
Ensure Unity Gizmos have not been disabled in the menu of the Scene window

To use with the HD Render Pipeline, please delete the following two folders 
Auto Fence Builder/AFWB_Materials
Auto Fence Builder/FencePrefabs_AFWB
Then import the 'AFWB HDRP Prefabs & Materials' unitypackage





Updating from AFWB 2.x to 3.x

Backup your Project Folder if you intend to overwrite a project currently using Auto Railtrack Builder. Preferably test-drive v3.0 in a new project first. • 'Finish' any live fences • Drag the folder 'UserGeneratedRailMeshes' out of the old Auto Railtrack Builder folder in the Assets folder • Completely remove the old version of Auto Railtrack Builder from the Hierarchy and the Project (Assets Folder).  Game Objects will have missing textures (and appear pink) after removing the old version, but will return when importing this new version. • After importing AFWB 3.0, put the 'UserGeneratedRailMeshes' folder back in to the top level of the 'Auto Railtrack Builder' folder
