I would recommend downloading the Official Unity PostProcessing stack (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912) and turning on Ambient Occlusion to improve the look of Low Poly models.

All pieces are <550 polygons, and come in 2 visually identical versions: standard (separate material) and optimized (single shared texture) version to allow both customization and optimization, depending on your needs.
Standard models are under the Models/Roman directory, and optimized versions are under the Models/Roman/Optimized directory.
